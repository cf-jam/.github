# 401 Midterm Project

## Team Agreement

### Cooperation Plan

* Team member strengths

* Mehtab -- Java logic and project management
* Joe -- Bugfinding, root cause problem analysis
* Armen -- Feature Implementation

For utilizing our strengths we will ensure that we have a good, fair division of labor and let our skillsets dictate our roles.

Everyone -- CSS!

Make sure we all ask questions of each other. We will have a rotating Github review process so that everyone gets a chance to see the others' work and be sure that they understand all aspects of the project.

### Conflict Plan

We will make sure to speak up to each other if there are issues. Any conflict can be resolved by a round-table approach in which we discuss the problem fairly and without bias. If this method does not work, we will resort to a random number generator.

We don't forsee this problem arising, but if it does we will confront the individual about them monopolizing the project. If no resolution is reached we will raise the issue with an instructor.

We don't foresee this being an issue but we will address the problem to the group member in question and make sure they understand the nature of the project and ask them what we can do to get them involved. If the initial discussion doesn't work, we will raise the issue with the instructional team.

We will arrange twice-daily meetings in order to align our goals for the day and do code review. If there are any differences in understanding/agreement over project flow, we will discuss them at this time. The afternoon meeting will be a debrief in order to come to a common understanding about how everything went for the day and set each other up for success for the following day.

We will talk to our instructor if we can't resolve the conflict within half a day.

### Communication Plan

Remo and Slack during "business hours" with adjustments for time differences and any individual's personal obligations. We will plan to be present at 9am PDT for stand-up with instructor and morning team meeting, after which time we will work asynchronously except for collaborative efforts like mob programming.

Breaks as needed.

Re-evaluate our MVP and the distribution of work amongst team members.

On an as-needed basis through Slack (No guarantee of a response)

We will have a rule in our internal meetings that everyone must offer a brief summary of their work for the day.

We will emphasize open communication and encourage questions to be asked about any subject at any time.

### Work Plan

We will be using Trello to describe tasks, assign work, and track the progress of the project each day. Implement mob programming using a robust domain model

### Git process

We will use a rotating commit/review process that ensures that everyone has an opportunity to review the others' code and make sure that there are no misunderstandings or critical differences in terms of project execution. We will implement this by making sure at least one member has to review the merge, this will be done through branch protections

The entire project will be hosted on GitHub.
The repo is in our organization where the rest of the team has collaborator/push access and are Admins.
We will have a production branch for deployment. We will all work on our personal development branch (Mehtab branch, Joe branch, Armen Branch) and push our changes to the overall development branch. Merges to main must be approved by the entire team.
Twice a day merges at meeting time to make sure there are no issues with code and any merge conflicts can be worked at as a team.
